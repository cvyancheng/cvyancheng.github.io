This is my first website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. The website contains my personal information and my thoughts every day. Sometimes I just write something boring, and other times I share something that inspires me. If you are interested in any of the topics, you’re welcome to read them!
